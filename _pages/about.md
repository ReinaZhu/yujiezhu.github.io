I am a graduate student in Computer Engineering at New York University. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision.

I earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the Southern University of Science and Technology in 2022, and was honored as an outstanding graduate of the Department of Mathematics.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
